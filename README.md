# File System Organizer

## Description
- Developed a command-line interface application in Node.js for organizing files in a directory based on their extensions.
- Created a CLI tool using the `fs` and `path` modules of Node.js and JavaScript to automate the organization of files.
- Implemented file categorization based on extensions into common categories.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js

## How to Test
1. To organize files by extension:
   ```bash
   node main.js organize "file-path"
   ```
2. To display the file structure in a tree format:
   ```bash
   node main.js tree "file-path"
   ```
3. To display help information:
   ```bash
   node main.js help
   ```
